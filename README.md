# Image processing and Edge detection for immunofluorescence
Script for evaluating polyploid cells in immunofluorescence images. Polyploidy causes alterations in total nuclear area in different ways, e.g. multiple nuclei, or a larger nucleus. Thus, ratio of total nuclear area to cell area can be an indicative of polyploid cells. Parameters for the image processing were tested for images produced by our group, staining nuclei with blue (DAPI) and cytoeskeleton with red (Phalloidin, alexa fluor 647). Always test the script's result with your images, and consider altering the processing parameters to better fit your images.
